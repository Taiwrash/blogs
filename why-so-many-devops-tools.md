## Best Practices

### 1. Always Include Frontmatter
Every markdown file should start with frontmatter containing:
- `title`: The display title of your post
- `excerpt`: A brief description (150-200 characters)
- `date`: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `tags`: Comma-separated list of relevant tags

### 2. Use Proper Heading Structure
- Use `#` for the main title (should match frontmatter title)
- Use `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Don't skip heading levels

### 3. Write Compelling Excerpts
The excerpt appears in the blog listing, so make it:
- Clear and concise
- Engaging enough to make people want to read more
- 150-200 characters long

### 4. Choose Relevant Tags
Tags help categorize your content:
- Use consistent tag names across posts
- Keep tags broad enough to be reusable
- Examples: "React", "DevOps", "Tutorial", "JavaScript", "Backend"

### 5. Structure Your Content
- Start with an engaging introduction
- Break content into digestible sections
- Use code examples when relevant
- End with a clear conclusion
