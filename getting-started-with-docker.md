# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post content that would normally be fetched from your GitHub repository.

## Key Points

- This demonstrates the blog post layout
- Comments and likes functionality
- Integration with Supabase for user interactions

## Code Example

```javascript
function hello() {
console.log("Hello from the blog!");
}
```

The actual content would be markdown from your GitHub repository at `https://github.com/taiwrash/blogs`.

You can implement the GitHub integration by:
1. Using the GitHub API to fetch markdown files
2. Converting markdown to HTML
3. Storing metadata in Supabase for comments and likes
